# Brain-Tumor-Detection-and-Segmentation-using-Deep-Learning-and-GenAI(Gemini Pro Vision)
This project leverages deep learning for accurate brain tumor detection on MRI images. Our custom CNN model achieved 97.50% accuracy. Using transfer learning with RESNET50v2, we achieved 93.3% accuracy. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) and Gemini Pro Vision model enhanced tumor boundary delineation and segmentation explanations.
